# sierpinski-triangle-react

This project is a recursive implementation of the Sierpiński triangle using React, Canvas, and TypeScript. The Sierpiński triangle is a fractal named after Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński. The triangle is formed by recursively dividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles and removing the central triangle. The resulting pattern is a beautiful and intricate fractal. In this project, we use React to render the Sierpiński triangle on a Canvas element and TypeScript for strict typing. The recursive implementation allows for the creation of Sierpiński triangles of varying sizes and levels of detail.
